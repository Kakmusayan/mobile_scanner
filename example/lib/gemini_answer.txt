The error message is telling you that your Flutter project needs Java 17 to build, but it's currently finding Java 11 on your system.

Here's how to fix it:

1. Verify your Android Studio JDK:

Open Android Studio and go to File > Project Structure > SDK Location.
Check the JDK location path. It should point to a JDK 17 installation. If not, download and install JDK 17 from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ and update the path here.
2. Update JAVA_HOME environment variable:

Windows:
Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows search bar.
Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
In the "System variables" section, look for a variable named "JAVA_HOME".
If it exists, edit it and set its value to the path of your JDK 17 installation (e.g., "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.2").
If it doesn't exist, click "New" and create a new system variable with the name "JAVA_HOME" and the value set to your JDK 17 path.
macOS/Linux:
Open your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc).
Add the following line, replacing /path/to/your/jdk-17 with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation:
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk-17
Save the file and run source ~/.bashrc (or the equivalent command for your shell) to apply the changes.
3. Update org.gradle.java.home in gradle.properties (Optional):

Open the gradle.properties file in your project's root directory.
Add or modify the following line to point to your JDK 17 installation: org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk-17
4. Invalidate Caches and Restart:

In Android Studio, go to File > Invalidate Caches / Restart... and click "Invalidate and Restart".
5. Clean and Rebuild:

Run flutter clean in your terminal from your project's root directory.
Then try running flutter run again.
If you've followed these steps and are still facing issues, provide the following information so I can assist you further:

Operating System: (e.g., Windows 10, macOS Monterey)
Flutter version: (run flutter --version in your terminal)
